# Modern Website Design (2020)

This repository contains a static website developed with HTML5 and modern CSS techniques such as CSS Grid, Flexbox, psuedo selectors, animation and more. Focus on making a modern look with a 2020 vibe is the main goal.

A modern website inspired from a YT tutorial made by Traversy Media. The video in question is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4&t=225s).

**ðŸš€  The web-server is deployed on the web via Google's Firebase.**
